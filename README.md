# Reading Log Proofs

## Description

Reading Log Proofs is a blockchain-based educational platform built on Aptos that revolutionizes how K-12 students track their reading progress. The system enables students to log their reading activities while teachers provide verification through blockchain attestations. Students earn digital badges and APT token rewards for verified reading milestones, creating a gamified and transparent learning environment.

The platform features a modern dark-mode web interface with simulated wallet integration, making blockchain technology accessible to educational institutions. Teachers can verify student entries, administrators can manage teacher registrations, and students can track their progress through an intuitive dashboard.

## Vision

Our vision is to transform traditional reading programs by leveraging blockchain technology to create:

- **Transparent Learning Records**: Immutable proof of student reading achievements stored on-chain
- **Incentivized Education**: Token-based rewards that motivate students to read more
- **Trusted Verification**: Teacher attestations that ensure authentic learning progress
- **Digital Literacy**: Early exposure to Web3 concepts through educational applications
- **Global Accessibility**: Decentralized platform accessible to schools worldwide

We envision a future where educational achievements are permanently recorded on blockchain, creating portable academic credentials that students own and control throughout their educational journey.
