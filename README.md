# Reading Log Proofs

## Description

Reading Log Proofs is a blockchain-based educational platform built on Aptos that revolutionizes how K-12 students track their reading progress. The system enables students to log their reading activities while teachers provide verification through blockchain attestations. Students earn digital badges and APT token rewards for verified reading milestones, creating a gamified and transparent learning environment.
